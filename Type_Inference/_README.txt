This project implements type inference with Prolog

Prolog Assignment COP4020 Dr. A Dobra

Work Completed by Christopher Preston 

The test cases are held in typeInf.plt

All the test cases have comments explaining what they test and
the expected result from that test. (i.e. some tests are designed to fail
to show the types are being inferred properly)

to run all the tests
: swipl

?- consult("typeInf.plt"), run_tests().
